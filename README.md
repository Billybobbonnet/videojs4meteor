## Video.js for Meteor

This package allows you to integrate video.js in your meteor application.

Two main differences with the other similar packages:

  - Video.js is up to date
  - Video.js is loaded as an asset so you wont have any file type errors

### Installation

type ```meteor add billybobbonnet:videojs4meteor```
