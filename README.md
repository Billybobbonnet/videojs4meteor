## Video.js for Meteor

This package allows you to integrate video.js in your meteor application.

### Read first

I would advise to use videojs directly following my instructions here: https://github.com/videojs/video.js/wiki/Integrate-video.js-in-meteor

This package is not satisfying as-is. See the wiki page for explanations.

### Installation

type ```meteor add billybobbonnet:videojs4meteor```

### You want video.js to be updated?

If video.js is outdated, you can fork, replace the content of video-js files by the new ones and create a pull request.
